    The project answers the question if two square matrixes that one is given from user and the second is created from the integers which given by user are traspose of eachother.  User must give two inputs the program. First one is a square matrix and the second or more are integers. 

    Number of integers is not important but if it is not a perfect square program will return false because of the created matrix by given integers will not be a square matrix

    If matrixes sizes are not equals then the program returns false.

    And finally if the two square matrixes are transpose of
each other then the program will return true.
